<h1 align="center">Eklavya: Path to empower future</h1>
</p>


## Inspiration 💡
- Over 37,000 undergraduates and 1500 school students were asked about their career aspirations and 52% of them agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “I have no idea what I want to do with my career”.
- Over 38% of currently enrolled students have shown their interest in seeking mentor support to help them in making the most of these opportunities.
- In a survey, we found that 3 out of  5 college freshers have a lot of hunger to learn but without any direction. It undermines their effort and some even relatively lose their direction.
- There has been over 80% growth in the number of opportunities but the number of applications doesn't seem to have substantial growth.
- 18 out of 25 students miss out on opportunities because of lack of information which results in frustration, anxiety, and stress.


## What is it? ⛹️‍♂️
Eklavya has 3 software subsystems.
1. An application that provide Easy Access to Professional Guidance. Users can get premium mentor support from the best in their field. They just have to pay according to the tier they choose and get amazing results. There are three tiers as of now:<br/><br/>
  i) Get your resume and LinkedIn profile reviewed and receive suggestions from professionals doing really well in the field.<br/>
  ii) Chat with your selected mentor, discuss your queries and difficulties along with a full resume review and custom roadmap.<br/>
  iii) Get on a video call and discuss your doubts and get a mock-interview experience with your mentor with a personalized roadmap.

2. An application where users can get regular notifications on opportunities like internships, placements, scholarships and so on. This way the user will never miss a single deadline due to a lack of awareness.

3. An application full of roadmaps for software learning tracks with FREE blogs, tutorials and articles to upskill users and gain all the skills they need to achieve their goals.

## How we built it 🧑‍💻
We built the frontend of the application using Flutter. We used a bottom bubble navigation bar to navigate through all the screens and components. For authentication we used Firebase while also using it in the chat application which was made using Socket.io and Firestore. Moreover, we used Razorpay for payment integration to the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
The biggest accomplishment for us was that we learned so many new things in the entire journey. Being a group of javascript developers, we tried our hands on Flutter this time. We are successfully able to integrate Razorpay as a payment gateway. Also we faced a lot of errors while creating the chat application as we had to use many technologies completely new to us. We were able to overcome all the challenges and were able to create a completely functional prototype the way we had envisioned. It was tiring, but fun as well. We are most proud of the fact that this product will be able to help many students across the globe.

## Business Scope 🔥
- Our major source of income from the very day of launch is expected to be from our premium tiers. The pricing between tiers 1, 2 and 3, which will further be named Alpha, Beta and Gamma, will be in the ratio of x, 3x and 5x respectively following industry standards.
- Approximately three months down the line, with a decent userbase, a custom opportunity can be embedded in the application. Companies who want to showcase their job listings in our application will be provided with three ways to partner. The ways are one-time contracts, yearly contracts, or lifetime contracts with the corresponding pricing.
- Approximately after hitting 10k userbase, we aim to approach ed-tech startups and companies for featuring their courses on our application with a pricing plan similar to that for the company partners.
